    <h1>What is Finance?</h1>
    <p>Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. It involves the use of credit and debt, securities, and investment to finance current projects using future income flows. Because of this temporal aspect, finance is closely linked to the time value of money, interest rates, and other related topics.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Finance can be broadly divided into three categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Public finance</li>
        <li>Corporate finance</li>
        <li>Personal finance</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Key Feature Terms</h2>
    <p><b>Assest:</b> An asset is something of value, such as cash, real estate, or property. A business may have current assets or fixed assets.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Liability:</b>A liability is a financial obligation, such as debt. Liabilities can be current or long-term.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Balance Sheet:</b>A balance sheet is a document that shows a company's assets and its liabilities. Subtract the liabilities from the assets to see the firm's net worth.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Cash Flow:</b> Cash flow is the movement of money into and out of a business or household.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Equity:</b>Equity means ownership. Stocks are called equities, because each share represents a portion of ownership.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Liquidity</b>Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be converted to cash. For example, real estate is not a very liquid investment, because it can take weeks or months to sell.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Profit:</b>Profit is the money left over after expenses. A profit and loss statement shows how much a business has earned or lost for a particular period.</p>

    <h2>History of Finance</h2>
    <p>Finance, as a study of theory and practice distinct from the field of economics, arose in the 1940s and 1950s with the works of Harry Markowitz, William F. Sharpe, Fischer Black, and Myron Scholes, to name just a few.
    Particular realms of finance—such as banking, lending, and investing, of course, money itself—have been around since the dawn of civilization in some form or another.<br>
    <br>
    The financial transactions of the early Sumerians were formalized in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (circa 1800 BCE). This set of rules regulated ownership or rental of land, employment of agricultural labor, and credit.
    Yes, there were loans back then, and yes, interest was charged on them—rates varied depending on whether you were borrowing grain or silver.
<br>
<br>
In ancient Rome, coins were stored in the basement of temples as priests or temple workers were considered the most honest, devout, and safest to safeguard assets. Temples also loaned money, acting as financial centers of major cities.</p>

<h1 class="type">Type of Finance</h1>
<h2>Public Finance</h2>
<p>The federal government helps prevent market failure by overseeing the allocation of resources, distribution of income, and stabilization of the economy. Regular funding for these programs is secured mostly through taxation.
    
     Borrowing from banks, insurance companies, and other governments and earning dividends from its companies also help finance the federal government.</p><br>
     <br>
<h2>Corporate Finance</h2>
<p>Businesses obtain financing through a variety of means, ranging from equity investments to credit arrangements. A firm might take out a loan from a bank or arrange for a line of credit. Acquiring and managing debt properly can help a company expand and become more profitable.<br><br>
    Startups may receive capital from angel investors or venture capitalists in exchange for a percentage of ownership. If a company thrives and goes public, it will issue shares on a stock exchange; such initial public offerings (IPO) bring a great influx of cash into a firm. Established companies may sell additional shares or issue corporate bonds to raise money. Businesses may purchase dividend-paying stocks, blue-chip bonds, or interest-bearing bank certificates of deposit (CDs); they may also buy other companies in an effort to boost revenue.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Personal Finance</h2>
    <p>Personal financial planning generally involves analyzing an individual's or a family's current financial position, predicting short-term, and long-term needs, and executing a plan to fulfill those needs within individual financial constraints. Personal finance depends largely on one's earnings, living requirements, and individual goals and desires.<br>
    <br>Matters of personal finance include but are not limited to: the securing of financial products like credit cards; life and home insurance; mortgages; and retirement products. Personal banking (such as checking and savings accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and 401(k) plans) is also considered a part of personal finance.</p>
